Water Quality Monitoring System – Safeguarding Water with IoT and AI

The Water Quality Monitoring System is an IoT and AI-powered web platform designed to monitor, analyze, and explain water quality conditions in urban areas. The system simulates IoT-based water quality sensors deployed across selected regions of Delhi to continuously collect key parameters such as pH, Total Dissolved Solids (TDS), turbidity, and temperature.

The collected data is securely processed on the backend and stored in a database for real-time and historical analysis. An AI-powered intelligence layer (Gemini API) evaluates both current and past readings to determine the overall water quality status, detect abnormal fluctuations, and generate clear, human-readable insights and recommendations. The AI not only provides a verdict (Good / Moderate / Poor) but also explains why the water quality is classified in that manner, ensuring transparency and trust.

The platform features a modern, interactive dashboard with multiple analytical visualizations including KPI cards, line graphs, bar charts, radar charts, pie charts, gauges, and trend indicators. These visual elements help users easily understand water quality patterns over time. A dedicated AI Insights page enhances the experience by offering detailed explanations, parameter-wise analysis, confidence indicators, and actionable suggestions for both citizens and authorities.

The system supports area-wise monitoring, allowing users to select specific locations and view their current and historical water quality data. Although the current implementation uses simulated IoT sensor data for demonstration purposes, the system architecture is fully scalable and compatible with real-world IoT hardware deployment.

This project is developed as a hackathon-ready prototype using React.js, Node.js, MongoDB, and Gemini AI, and is suitable for applications in smart cities, public health monitoring, and data-driven water resource management.

In summary, the project demonstrates how IoT and AI can transform traditional water monitoring into an intelligent, proactive, explainable, and citizen-centric system that helps safeguard one of our most vital resources—water.
